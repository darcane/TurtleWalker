# Logo Walker

Logo was developed in the late 1960s at Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc., in Cambridge, MA by W. Feurzeig, D. Bobrow and S. Papert. Its purpose was to teach children to program. Its central feature is that it provides simple commands for moving a `turtle` on a surface. Initially the language was used to direct the motion of a small robot that was dressed up to look like a `turtle`. It was placed on a sheet of paper and dragged a pen underneath it, thereby drawing figures on the paper. Today the `turtle` is a small arrow-like figure that moves on the screen of a computer.
